## Setup

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(glmnet)
library(caret)
```

## Data

For this exercise we use the Communities and Crime data from the UCI ML repository, which includes information about communities in the US. "The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR"

Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime

First, some data prep.

```{r}
crime <- read.csv("communities.data", header = FALSE, na.strings = "?")
varnames <- read.delim("communities.txt", header = FALSE)
```

Clean name vector and use as variable names.

```{r}
varnames <- as.character(varnames$V1)
varnames <- gsub("@attribute ", "", varnames)
varnames <- gsub(" numeric", "", varnames)
varnames <- gsub(" string", "", varnames)
names(crime) <- varnames
```

To make things easier, drop columns with missing values.

```{r}
crime <- crime[, colSums(is.na(crime)) == 0]
```

Check whats left.

```{r}
str(crime)
```

## Train and test set

Next, we want to split the data into a training (75%) and a test (25%) part. This can be done by random sampling with `sample`. Note that there is a `fold` variable in the data set, but here we want to follow our own train/test procedure.

```{r}
set.seed(3940)

crime_train <-
crime_test <-
```

Now, prepare the training data for running regularized regression models via `glmnet`. Our prediction outcome is `ViolentCrimesPerPop`. As X, use all variables except `state`, `communityname`, and `fold`. 

```{r}
X <-

y <-
```

Check whether X looks ok.

```{r}
dim(X)
```

### Lasso

Estimate a sequence of Lasso models using `glmnet`. You can stick with the defaults for choosing a range of lambdas.

```{r}

```

Here we want to display lambda and the coefficients of the first Lasso model.

```{r}

```

Same for the last Lasso model.

```{r}

```

Now, plot the coefficient paths.

```{r}

```

Next, we need to decide which Lasso model to pick for prediction. Use Cross-Validation for this purpose.

```{r}

```

And plot the Cross-validation results.

```{r}

```

In your own words, briefly describe the CV plot. (1) What is plotted here, (2) what can you infer about the relation between the number of variables and prediction accuracy? 

#### Start text...

#### end

Now, store the lambda value of the model with the smallest CV error as `bestlam1`.

```{r}

```

Create `bestlam2` as the lambda according to the 1-standard error rule.

```{r}

```

### Prediction in test set

Finally, we investigate the performance of our models in the test set. For this task, construct a X matrix from the test set.

```{r}
Xt <- 
```

Use the `predict` function to generate predicted values for both models (i.e., both lambdas stored earlier).

```{r}

```

Compute the test MSE of our models.

```{r}

```

In addition, use another performance metric and compute the corresponding values for both models.

```{r}

```

Which model is better? Does it depend on the performance measure that is used?
