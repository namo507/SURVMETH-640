## Overview

This analysis looks at data from the English Premier Leage from 1992/92 to 2021/22 seasons in order to explore the correlation between transfer spending and success on the pitch. The data was scraped from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk) and can be downloaded from [this Github repo](https://github.com/kevbradwick/soccer-db).

## Permier League Winners

First, let's take a look at all the title winning clubs and how many times they won it.

```{r echo=FALSE}
winners <- data %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  arrange(position, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(position == 1)

winners_summary <- winners %>% 
  group_by(club) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_wins = n(),
    total_spend = sum(expenditure_m),
    total_spend_fmt = formatC(total_spend, format = "f", big.mark = ",", digits = 1),
    average_expenditure = mean(expenditure_m),
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_wins))

ggplot(winners_summary, aes(x = reorder(club, total_wins), y = total_wins)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = total_wins), colour = "white", hjust = 2) +
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Club", y = "Times won")
```

Manchester United mark their historic dominance with a total of 13 Premier League title wins in 30 seasons. We can take a look at how much each club spent on average and as a total for their title wins.

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(winners_summary %>% select(club, total_spend, average_expenditure), caption = "Expenditure for each title win", col.names = c("Club names", "Total Expenditure (M) EUR", "Average per title (M) EUR"))
```

### Expenditure vs. League Position

Spending big, doesn't equate to a higher league position either. The following scatter plot displays where each club finished against the expenditure for that season.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(expenditure_m, position)) +
  geom_point(colour = "steelblue") +
  theme_light() +
  labs(x = "Expenditure (M) EUR", y = "Position")
```

### Spending over time

How has spending in the Premier League changed over time?

```{r echo=FALSE}
spend_over_time <- data %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarise(total_expenditure = sum(expenditure_m))

ggplot(spend_over_time, aes(x = season, y = total_expenditure)) +
  geom_line(colour = "steelblue") +
  geom_point(shape=21, color="steelblue", fill="white", size=2) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(x = "Season", y = "Expenditure (M) EUR")
```
